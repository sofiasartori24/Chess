{ In perhaps the most instructive (mindblowing $2) endgame of the year to date, our friendly neighborhood Fish defeated the dragon in the 13th edition of Chess.com's Computer Chess Championship. I have analyzed the endgame below for my blog here, and you can enjoy Grandaster Dejan Bojkov's notes (with a few of my own comments sprinkled in) before move 43. }
