1. d4 f5 2. e4
{ The romantic Staunton gambit, is not a common opening choice
these days, but it's a good test of the engine's attacking abilities. Further,
one could argue the \"postional principles\" behind White's approach agaisnt any
Dutch (to ultimately challenge on the central light-squares) is only accelerated
in fine (AlphaZeroish?) fasion here! As someone who's personally been playing
the Staunton Gambit himself for years, believing in its ideals of directly
opening up Black's weakest diagonals, I was rather excited (dare I say proud?)
to see this on the board! }

least chess fans (and maybe even some professional players) still have
interesting, creative chess to look at in the advanced these days! }

\"up pieces\" where it matters, despite being down a minor. }
) 9. d6 $5
{ An
unusual, but strong attacking idea. White aims to keep the queenside blocked to
prevent pieces from developing. As we said when ...c6 was first played (it came
with the price of delaying queenside development), Leela wants to ensure that
Stockfish pays up for this misstep. Chess fundamentals have preached
development, activity, coordination, etc as assets to value over small amounts
of material for years, and the love child (can I say that?) of Open-Source
engine development and AlphaZero (Lc0) continues to drive home the romantic
style that our forefathers played with! }

) 12... Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qf6 14. O-O

development. This sort of hard to evaluate sacrifice demonstrates the difference
between a standard engine like Stockfish and a neural network like Lc0. Both
sides evaluate this position as in their favor. }

what!? Even though there's no check, White still gives up the bishop (and all
forms of sanity!) to stick with the principled positional anti-Dutch
breakthrough! I will have my light-squares, screams Leela!Black has so few
pieces developed that it's difficult to defend. At this point Stockfish started
to realize that White's attack is strong, and if you give the strongest versions
of Komodo enough time to think (as I did during analysis), even the fire
breathing Lizard eventually agrees that White has compensation. }
