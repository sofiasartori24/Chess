{ The main idea of this game, in my view, is patience. Funny to say such a thing
in a computer's game. But it's a key factor to play chess on a supreme level.
Don't be in a hurry, just reinforce your position all the time while trying to
restrict your opponent's counterplay. Stockfish will do this in different stages
of this game. }

{ The Paulsen Variaton of
the Sicilian Defense. It's one of the most flexibel Sicilians: it can transpose
to a Taimanov, to the Scheveningen or develop a life of its own. It's not the
most popular of Sicilian's at top level. }

popular. } 5... Nf6 ( 5... Bc5

{ Black allows White to build the sctructure known as \"The Maroczy Bind\".
These positions are also known as \"The Hedgehog\" - they are very solid for
Black and once White tries to attack he might get hurt by the hedgehog quills.
It is well established that White gets a small advantage in these positions, but
Black's position is not without chances. Computers are fond of a space
advantage, so I suppose Stockfish was pretty \"happy\" here. }

{ The Hedghehog is all
about patience. The most important thing for White is to prevent the typical
pawn breaks b6-b5 or d6-d5. Once this is achieved, comes the question: how to
break Black's position? It will probably be necessary to advance the pawns at
some point, either on the queenside or on the kingside, but it's important to be
very careful when doing that. Sometimes a human player gets bored with all the
necessary maneuvers and start action too quickly. Obviously this does not happen
with Stockfish in this game. }
14. Qd2 $1
{ I like this move a lot. White prepares
to move the bispo to f1 and the queen can support the pressure on the d6 pawn or
maybe some Be3-h6 in the future. }

{ A new
move. What's the point of it? Hard to say. Maybe play b2-b4 at some point with
the pawn defended, so Black has no d6-d5 idea (with a possible threat on the
b4-pawn). I think the computer just see that Black has no counterplay for now
and improves the tiniest details of the position. }
